I am logging sensor data using Home Assistant and analysing the data with python in a Jupyter notebook.

## PM10 event June 17 2020
Some nice pm10 data. Blue is kitchen and orange is office. Something was large enough to be detected in both places and clearly originated in the kitchen, think it was frying a burger. The large spikes in the kitchen are probably our baby bottle steriliser which produces fine water vapour.
